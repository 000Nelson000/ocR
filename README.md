R bindings to Tesseract. Tesseract is probably the most accurate open source OCR
engine available. Combined with the Leptonica Image Processing Library it can
read a wide variety of image formats and convert them to text in over 60 languages.
It was one of the top 3 engines in the 1995 UNLV Accuracy test. Between 1995
and 2006 it had little work done on it, but since then it has been improved
extensively by Google. It is released under the Apache License 2.0.
